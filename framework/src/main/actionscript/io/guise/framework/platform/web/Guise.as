/**
 * Guise ActionScript for support functionality based in Flash 10.
 * <p>
 * <code>audio/wav</code> support is added using AS3WavSound, with supported sample rates of 44100Hz, 22050Hz, or
 * 11025Hz, and bitrates of 8 or 16, are supported. Sounds are given the following additional properties:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>id:String</dt>
 * <dd>The ID of the sound.</dd>
 * <dt>state:TaskState</dt>
 * <dd>The current playing state of the sound.</dd>
 * <dt>startPosition:Number</dt>
 * <dd>The position of the sound to use when playing is commenced.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * This class requires the Guise.js runtime on the host browser, with the following callback methods defined:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>guise._onFlashInitialize()</code></li>
 * <li><code>guise._onSoundStateChange()</code></li>
 * <li><code>guise._onSoundPositionChange()</code></li>

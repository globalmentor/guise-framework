 * <dt>{@link LayoutPanel}</dt>
 * <dd>A class only used for laying out child components without providing extra arrangement such as inter-child-component spacing.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link ArrangePanel}</dt>
 * <dd>A panel that semantically demarcates an area that arranges other components. This panel is usually styled to arrange the spacing between child
 * components.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link SectionPanel}</dt>
 * <dd>A panel that demarcates a semantically significant area of the a parent component with arranged child components.</dd>

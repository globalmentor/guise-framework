 * The default strategy for keeping track of prototype providers and working with provisioned prototypes, merging them into a menu and/or a toolbar. When the
 * prototype providers change provided prototypes, those provided prototypes are processed. This version monitors the parent composite component children and
 * automatically uses top-level prototype providers added to or removed from the hierarchy. Prototype provisions are not processed initially; this strategy
 * should be initialized after construction by calling {@link #processPrototypeProvisions()}. This class is thread safe based upon its exposed read and write
 * locks.

/**
 * Abstract strategy for keeping track of prototype providers and working with provisioned prototypes. When the prototype providers change provided prototypes,
 * those provided prototypes are processed. This version monitors the parent composite component children and automatically uses top-level prototype providers
 * added to or removed from the hierarchy. Prototype provisions are not processed initially; this strategy should be initialized after construction by calling
 * {@link #processPrototypeProvisions()}. This class is thread safe based upon its exposed read and write locks.

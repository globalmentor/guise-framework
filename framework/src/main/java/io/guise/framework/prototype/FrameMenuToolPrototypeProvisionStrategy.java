/**
 * The default strategy for keeping track of prototype providers and working with provisioned prototypes, merging them into the current menu and/or a toolbar of
 * a frame. When the prototype providers change provided prototypes, those provided prototypes are processed. This version monitors the parent composite
 * component children and automatically uses top-level prototype providers added to or removed from the hierarchy. Prototype provisions are not processed
 * initially; this strategy should be initialized after construction by calling {@link #processPrototypeProvisions()}. This class is thread safe based upon its
 * exposed read and write locks.
